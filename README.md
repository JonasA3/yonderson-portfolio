# 🌐 Yonderson – Developer Portfolio

Welcome to the codebase for [Yonderson.se](https://yonderson.se) — my personal portfolio site where I showcase my frontend development skills, highlight real-world coding techniques, and share projects in a clean, accessible, and user-first experience.

This site reflects my approach to modern web development — component-based architecture, strong typing, accessibility, and user preferences like dark mode and language selection.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Astro](https://astro.build/) (server-rendered mode)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **UI Interactivity**: [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) (used for toggles, dropdowns, scroll indicators)
- **Icons**: [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) (via static or Svelte packages)
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier
- **Deployment**: [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for lint/format checks on push

## 🌍 Multilingual Support (EN/SV)

The site supports both English and Swedish via a cookie-based language preference. Language is:

- Stored in `localStorage` + `document.cookie`
- Read server-side via `Astro.cookies.get('lang')`
- Passed into layouts and components for dynamic translation using a centralized `t[lang]` object

A helper and middleware file are also included for future expansion (like automatic redirects, fallbacks, or localization headers).
